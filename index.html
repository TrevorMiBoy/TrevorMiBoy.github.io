      <div class="post-content">
        <p>So sharing my accomplishment with others has been....underwhelming.</p>
        <p>I was really looking forward to hear some words of encouragement and pride when I showed
           my first website to people. However, the great anticipation of excitement from those close to me
           was met with a boorish "cool."</p>
        <p>*Sigh* Oh well, I guess making things like this are more commonplace as than it was back in
            back in high school I suppose. Anyway, I know that at least <em>I'm</em> proud of my accomplishemt.
            I can't stop thinking about this now found ability as each moment brings me back to what could I do for
             my next project. I really look forward to what this new found skill means for my future career. I believe
            my future just got a lot brighter :). </p>

      <div class="post-content">
        <p>If somebody would have told me a week ago that I would
           be able to make a website, I would <br>
           not have believed them.</p>
        <p>Just a few days later, I came across
          <a href="https://getmimo.com/">Mimo</a> and started to work
        on a <em>real</em> blog.</p>
