      <h3 class="post-title">So I guess the past two days was target practice... and I was the target.</h3>
      <div class="post-content">
        <p>Disclaimer, it's not like I was injured or anything, but....</p>
        <p>It's rather shocking about what things students will do especially out of dislike for a teacher. As my back has been turned for only a second, I've had two pencils thrown at me on two seperate days and classes.
        First attempt was a definate miss but I'm sure that if they wanted to hit me, they would've (Should I be thanking him for not hitting me?). The pencil made a loud *thwack* against the wall next to me after he returned
       to class after having been sent out by myself for being disruptive <strong>during a TEST</strong>. "Oops, I missed," he said, implying that he was aiming for the trash can next to me... Yeah, <em>that's</em> what you were aiming for.
     The second attempt came a day later while I was helping the students understand the answer to the question of the bellwork that they were supposed to have already answered before class began. My back was turned and suddenly I felt a smack
    against my back and the clatter of the pencil on the floor behind me. Silently, I pick up the pencil and turn around to the class. Give a calm, yet sturn lecture about being respectful and safe in the classroom. "If I so much as see you throw a paper
    in this room, I will send you out of here so fast, you're head will be spinning. Also, since it doesn't appear that I have your respect, I guess this test went from open-note, to a close-note test." "I don't think anyone threw a pencil at you Mr. Hathcock," protested whom had been
  acting rather suspicious during the whole event. *Face palm*</p>
          <p>I chuckle to myself as I write this as I think on about the things that
        what my classmates did to my English teacher my freshman year of high school. I laugh because my reaction was far different than what
      hers was when having a gummy worm thrown at her computer screen as she worked. "It's raining gummy worms!" she exlaimed, and popped it into her mouth.
     In great shock, the culprit sheepishly asked, "you didn't just eat that did you? I found that outside on the ground." She ignored him and went back to her work.</p>
     <p>I'm not sure if that is out of embarrasment or what but that poor teacher had it rough with that class. Speaking of former teachers, I was at the store the other day and I walked
      past one of my former teachers and was rather excited to recognize him. He wasn't a particularly great teacher, the fact that he was one of <em>MY</em> teachers, he was more important to me than
     some of the other teachers that I had had throughout high school. He was one of the few that I had had more than one year. I wish that I had run into him further into the store and greet him and tell him
    thank you for being my teacher and that I had wished that I had thanked my teachers more for their efforts in educating me, not that I was particulary good at learning at the time.</p>
    <p>In other news, I'm still making progress on the Mimo app, but there is still a problem with figuring out how to incorporate javascript into my website. *Sigh*, needs more practice.
    Although, I have thought about trying out my HTML and CSS skills in making this website more personalized as well as creating my own from scratch to see how much I've actually retained from my practicing.
  On one hand, I've got the content pretty much down on my other site, on the other hand, my structure and layout work needs....well, work. #babysteps (cringing at writing my first hashtag).</p>
  <p>Until next time, "take it sleezy", Michael (The Good Place)</p>

      <div class="post-content">
        <p>I'm up to 17 day streak on Mimo.</p>
        <p>I've made some progress but not nearly as much as I'd like. Mainly because I have my job to work on throughout the day consistently.
        My goodness, students can be such a pain sometimes. Well, it seems recently that everyone else is to blame for <em>their own</em> mistakes.
      Certainly can't have them taking responsibility for their own actions. Luckly, I've got some support from the parents at home in order to take care
    of some of the behavior issues that their children are demonstrating in school. Currently trying to figure out how to make a comment section for users
  but a little stuck on that problem for the time being. I'll figure it out eventually.</p>

      <div class="post-content">
        <p>So sharing my accomplishment with others has been....underwhelming.</p>
        <p>I was really looking forward to hear some words of encouragement and pride when I showed
        my first website to people. However, the great anticipation of excitement from those close to me
      was met with a boorish "cool."</p>
      <p>*Sigh* Oh well, I guess making things like this are more commonplace as than it was back in
      back in high school I suppose. Anyway, I know that at least <em>I'm</em> proud of my accomplishemt.
    I can't stop thinking about this now found ability as each moment brings me back to what could I do for my next project. I really look forward to what this new found skill means for my future career. I believe
    my future just got a lot brighter :). </p>
