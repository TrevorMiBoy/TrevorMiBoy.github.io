        <p>Hello World! Welcome to my first attempt at a blog.</p>
        <p>Honestly, I'm still rather giddy about the fact that I now know how to develop a website. 
        I'm going to say, I never thought I'd actually be able to do it. It's always been a dream of 
        mine to be a programmer. I never persued it because of two reasons. First, when I signed up for computer 
        courses at the local tech college through my high school, they signed me up for the absolute basic classes. Classes 
        that would bore you out of your mind. Not even a class really. I was not very driven because of that class, plus I really 
        wanted to be done with school my senior year of high school (can you blame me?). Second, I lacked confidence. I 
        didn't grow-up with computers, unlike most of my other friends who played with them all the time.
        I really enjoyed the computer programming class I took my senior year of high school, but when you have a kid who's last name 
          is "Smart" in your programming class whom the teacher even asks <em>him</em> for assistance in figuring out coding errors, 
        ya kinda feel inadiquate.</p>
